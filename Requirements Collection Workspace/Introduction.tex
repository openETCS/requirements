\chapter{Introduction}

This documents presents the first collection of requirements for means of descriptions, methodologies and tools to establish a formal development process and a related toolchain. As this first collection of requirements is based on 14 interviews with experts from the railway sector and other industries. Overall between September and November 2012 21 experts from 12 organisation have answered questions concerning their development approaches, their experiences with different means of descriptions, methodologies and tools, and their requirements for formal model based development. Since the experts overall only described general requirements, more detail have to be defined to establish the requirements for all aspects of the software development process. Furthermore this collection of requirements does not provide any comparison of requirements to assess  their affiliations.

As this first list shall serve as help to find a structured approach for the requirement collection further discussions have to specify the following hierarchical levels for all requirements to allow traceability:
