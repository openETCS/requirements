\section{Means of Description}

The VDI/VDE 3681 guideline provides a list of characteristics to classify means of description. This includes the following seven characteristics which could be used to group the requirements:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt, partopsep=2pt,itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
  \item Formal basis
  \item Representation
  \item Description of structure
  \item Description of behaviour
  \item Explicit time representation
  \item Synchronisation
  \item Tool support
\end{itemize}

Additionally the following two aspects are relevant for means of descriptions:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt, partopsep=2pt,itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
  \item Required expertise
  \item Level of standardisation
\end{itemize}

Table /ref{tab:reqMoD} list the requirements that have been named during the interviews. Thereby the requirements are structured according to VDI/VDE 3681 characteristics.

\multirow{1}{*}{Level of standardisation} & Well documented (better standardised) & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Methodology}

The main requirements for the methodologies are provided by the EN 50128. The Open Proof approach in general only requires a combination of formal methods and model-based development as basis for verification and validation through formal proofs and testing.

The following requirements have been named during the interviews:
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conform to CENELEC standards
\item Easy to apply in practice
\item Clear traceability of changes and their influences
\item Provide mainly automatic theorem proving and model checking
\end{itemize}

\section{Tools}

As presented during the CENELEC workshop in Paris the ISO/IEC 9126 classifies software quality by six characteristics.  These have been used in table \ref{tab:reqtools} to make a first grouping of all requirements for tools presented during the interviews.

\textbf{Characteristic} & \textbf{Property} & \textbf{Measurement} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{Functionality} &  Compatible with existing configuration management systems & & \\ \cline{2-4}
