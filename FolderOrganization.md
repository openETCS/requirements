# Folder Organization Proposal for WP2

The folders should be organized the following way in the requirement repository

* Requirements : main requirement repository
 * D2.1 : State of the art 
 * D2.2 : Definition of methodology
 * D2.3 : Requirements
  * D2.3.1 : ... on modeling
  * D2.3.2 : ... on API
  * D2.3.3 : ... on tools
  * D2.3.4 : ... on V&V
  * Synthesis 
 * Benchmarking : Benchmarking of methodologies and tools
 * MinutesOfMeetings : Self explanatory
 * Workspace : All temporary documentation that does not fit anywhere
 * ReferenceDocuments : Delivered reference versions of documents
  * RequirementsSynthesis : Delivered version of D2.3/Synthesis

Question : The state of the art has already been put in another repository (methodology-report). Should it be migrated
or just linked to from D2.1?
