# Folder Organization Proposal for WP2

The folders should be organized the following way in the requirement repository

* Requirements : main requirement repository
    * D2.1 : State of the art 
    * D2.2 : Definition of methodology
        * D2.2.1 : Definition of the overall process for the formal description of ETCS and the rail system it works in
        * D2.2.2 : Definition of the methods used to perform the formal descriptionÂ 
        * D2.2.3 : Methods and tools benchmarking methodology
    * D2.3 : Requirements
        * D2.3.1 : ... on modeling
        * D2.3.2 : ... on API
        * D2.3.3 : ... on tools
        * D2.3.4 : ... on V&V
        * Synthesis 
    * Benchmarking : Benchmarking of methodologies and tools [MPD : I  guess is a part of D2.2.3]
    * MinutesOfMeetings : Self explanatory
    * Workspace : All temporary documentation that does not fit anywhere
    * ReferenceDocuments : Delivered reference versions of documents
        * RequirementsSynthesis : Delivered version of D2.3/Synthesis



Question : The state of the art has already been put in another repository (methodology-report). Should it be migrated
or just linked to from D2.1? [MPD : Yes I think the organization will be clearer]
